# LiquorSalesAnalysis
Final Project for MSDS6371

This paper aims to understand which food-store factors influence daily beer sales in the Chicago area. We are interested in whether or not wine sales are correlated with beer sales. The answer to this would determine whether beer and wine act as complementary or substitution goods in the grocery store environment. I test whether other factors such as frozen food sales, customer count, spirits sales, and others have any relationship with total daily beer sales. The goal of this analysis is to better understand aggregated consumer behaviour to aid in decision making for any local food store in the Chicago area. I also examine the affect that the Thanksgiving Holiday season may have on beer sales.
